1. Data Collection

Source: X-Plane 11 simulator (engine sensor logs).

Format: .txt logs → converted into .csv.

Features captured:

Engine RPM, N1, N2

Thrust, Fuel flow, EGT, Oil temp/pressure

Electricals (voltage, amps)

Flight parameters (altitude, IAS, climb rate)

2. Data Preprocessing

Parse .txt logs into structured CSV.

Clean dataset:

Remove duplicate & constant columns.

Handle missing values (NaN imputation).

Convert units if needed.

Labeling:

Inject synthetic failures when thresholds exceeded (e.g., RPM > 110%, EGT too high).

Create failure target column.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize sensor distributions (histograms, KDE).

Correlation heatmaps (to find key predictors).

Time-series plots (RPM, N1, Oil Temp vs timestep).

Identify anomalies/spikes before failures.

4. Feature Engineering

Create rolling averages (e.g., 5-step moving average of RPM).

Calculate deltas (e.g., ∆ Oil Temp per second).

Normalize/scale continuous features.

Save processed dataset (data/processed/xplane_features.csv).

5. Modeling
5.1 XGBoost (baseline)

Handles tabular data well.

Train/Test split with stratification.

Handle imbalance with:

scale_pos_weight

SMOTE (if needed).

Save trained model (models/xplane_xgboost.pkl).

5.2 LSTM (time-series)

Input: sequential sensor values.

Architecture: LSTM → Dense → Sigmoid.

Train on sequences with failure labels.

Save trained model (models/xplane_lstm.h5).

6. Evaluation

Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

Visualizations:

Confusion Matrix (XGBoost + LSTM).

ROC Curves.

Training Loss/Accuracy Curves (LSTM).

Store plots in reports/figures/.

7. Deployment

Wrap best model into API/Dashboard:

Streamlit → Live dashboard for predictions.

Flask/FastAPI → REST endpoint for failure probability.

Integrate CI/CD (/Jenkins) for deployment.

8. Monitoring

Track model drift with new simulator logs.

Retrain pipeline if accuracy drops.

Collect predictions & feedback for improvement.
